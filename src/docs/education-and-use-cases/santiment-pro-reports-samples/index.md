### On latest BTC fundamentals and the push to $14k

*With the U.S. election right around the corner and the third wave of Covid-19 sweeping the globe, we decided to take a deep look at the recent behavior of key Bitcoin stakeholders, and evaluate the top coin’s on-chain and social potential since the $13k push.*

In this Santiment report, we take a closer look at the size of the ERC-20 market, its separate evolution over the years and its - if any - correlation to the ‘parent’ market cap of Ethereum.*
