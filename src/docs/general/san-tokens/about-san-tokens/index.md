title: What you can currently do with your SAN tokens
author: Santiment Team

There are several use cases for our SAN token:
- some have already been implemented,
- others are in active development.

Let's cover the most important ones below:

## Discount Token


Since August 2019, we have officially ended our beta phase and
transitioned over to having FIAT subscription plans for access. You can
read more about the [announcement
here](https://santiment.net/blog/san-next-chapter/).

In view of this, SAN tokens can now be used as a discount to offset
the price plans. Token holders will get 20% off all pricing plans for
all of our [products](/intercom-articles/getting-started/get-started/current-products-of-santiment).

## Token Burning

We are working to add the option to gain access to our products
through burning of SAN tokens instead of through fiat subscriptions.
