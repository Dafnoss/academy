## 1. Get some ETH (or BTC)

(can be purchased at an exchange using a currency of your choice, e.g.
[Bitfinex](https://bitfinex.com/t/SAN:USD)).

## 2. Install MetaMask and create an ETH account

(or attach an existing account).(<https://metamask.io/>)


## Sell ETH/BTC for SAN

#### Using our integration with Bancor - ETH only

To find out how to use your Bancor integration to easily trade ETH for
SAN in a single transaction, please check out [this
article](/general/san-tokens/how-to-buy-san-tokens-using-bancor).

#### Using an exchange of your choice

<https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/santiment/#markets>
lists a lot of different exchanges SAN tokens are traded on.


SAN is available at the regular centralized
[Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/t/SAN:USD) exchange for ETH, BTC, and
USD/USDT, but our team has had positive experiences with using their
more decentralized alternative <https://trustless.ethfinex.com/>

Please refer to the documentation of your chosen exchange for more
details.

In case you used this approach, you can jump straight to the last bullet
point.


## 3. Transfer the SAN to the Metamask account you created in Step 2

In case you used a centralized exchange to buy your SAN tokens, you need
to withdraw them to your account you use with MetaMask. This step is
already taken care of in case you used the Bancor integration to buy
your SAN tokens.

## What to do now?

Now just be logged in to Metamask with that account selected when you
visit Sanbase and [log in by
MetaMask](/sanbase/logging-into-sanbase).
We'll detect the SAN you're holding and grant you access to more data,
based on the amount of tokens you hold.
