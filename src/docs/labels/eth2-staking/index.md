## Description

The eth2_staking label is used to identify wallet addresses that are actively participating in the Ethereum 2.0 staking process. Ethereum 2.0 is an upgrade to the Ethereum network that transitions it from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

By applying the eth2_staking label to specific addresses, you can quickly identify wallets that are involved into staking activities. Staking involves locking up a certain amount of ETH as a validator in the Ethereum network, participating in the block validation process, and earning rewards in return for helping to secure the network.
