## Description

Any smart contract which is an NFT collection contract should have the `nft-collection` label assigned to it. There are two main standards for NFT contracts: ERC721 and ERC1155. We make sure to assign a label for each standard. And if the collection has a name or/and symbol that's easily accessible, we create labels for those too.
