## Description

_Owner_ is a standalone label which denotes the person or company which controls a given address. Note that owner label is not a nickname. Owner is a broader term rather than nickname which is an owner's attribute (e.g. Vitalik Buterin might have several nicknames: 'Vitaliy', 'ETH_daddy', 'Jogn Galt', etc).

In most cases _owner_ label is connected with other labels (such as _centralized_exchange_).
