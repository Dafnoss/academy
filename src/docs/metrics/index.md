Santiment brings a comprehensive set of metrics together in one place so you can
get a better picture of what’s happening with your favorite crypto assets and/or
crypto markets in general. We emphasize plotting metrics against price over
time, to more easily spot how trends and events correlate with price action.

## Financial

Traditional fundamentals including price, volume and market cap, mean coin age
