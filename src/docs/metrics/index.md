Santiment brings a comprehensive set of metrics together in one place so you can get a better picture of what’s happening with your favorite crypto assets and/or crypto markets in general.
We emphasize plotting metrics against price over time, to more easily spot how trends and events correlate with price action.


## Financial

Traditional fundamentals including price, volume and market cap, plus crypto-related data like total supply, circulating supply, top transactions, ETH spent by the team and ROI since ICO (if applicable)

- Price
- Volume
- Marketcap
- [Mean Coin Age](/metrics/mean-coin-age). For each coin we see how long it has stayed at its current address and we compute the average of all those ages. The difference between "coin age" and "dollar age" comes from the different way that we compute the averages.
- Mean dollar invested age

## Social/Sentiment

Metrics taken from measuring social activity on crypto-related forums and channels, plus custom sentiment measurements analyzing crowd behavior. Includes emerging trend words and projects, word clouds to display related words and the possibility to enter custom search terms.

## Development
