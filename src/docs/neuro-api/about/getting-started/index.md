Neuro by Santiment is a comprehensive cryptocurrency API which
utilizes[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for flexibility and function. It
can be accessed in several ways, including:

-   Via your programming language of choice using its built-in graphql
    client.
-   Directly via the [command
    line](/intercom-articles/getting-started/sanbase-api/using-the-sanbase-api-from-the-command-line)
    using the \'curl\' command
-   If you're used to Python, our [\'Sanpy\'
    wrappe](https://github.com/santiment/sanpy)r is ideal for quick data
    access in only a few lines of code. You can also find implementation
    examples for R, Ruby, Elixir and other programming languages in
    [this repository](https://github.com/santiment/san-sdk) (with more
    examples added in the future).

You can also give Neuro a try using our web-based [API
explorer](https://api.santiment.net/graphiql), which features a complete
schema search engine nested in the upper right corner.

For detailed explanations of all API-accessible metrics, check out our
API [knowledge
base](/#api).

Please note that you can gain access to additional metrics, more
historical data and higher rate limits by purchasing one of our [Paid
API plans](https://neuro.santiment.net). If you're interested in
expanding Neuro's capabilities, you can upgrade your existing plan
through your [Account page](https://neuro.santiment.net/account/)at any
time.
