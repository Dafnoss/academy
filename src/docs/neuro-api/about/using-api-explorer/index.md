Our [GraphQL Explorer](https://api.santiment.net/graphiql) allows you to
experiment with our API. You can:

-   Run sample queries on the left
-   See the results on the right
-   Read the compiled documentation of our GraphQL schema on the right
    sidebar

For details on how to use the API through your command line, please

You will find details on single API metrics in this knowledge base, too
- e.g. [this article on Daily Active
Adresses](/intercom-articles/metrics-explained/api/api-of-metric-daily-active-addresses).
