Our [GraphQL Explorer](https://api.santiment.net/graphiql) allows you to
experiment with our API. You can:

-   Run sample queries on the left
-   See the results on the right
-   Read the compiled documentation of our GraphQL schema on the right
    sidebar

For details on how to use the API through your command line, please
[click
here](/neuro-api/about/using-api-from-the-command-line/).

You will find details on single API metrics in this knowledge base, too
- e.g. [this article on Daily Active
Adresses](/neuro-api/metrics/daily-active-addresses/).
