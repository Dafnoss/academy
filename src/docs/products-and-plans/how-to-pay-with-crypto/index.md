> **Note:** Payment in crypto is only available for yearly subscriptions, not for monthly ones.

## Pay With ETH or DAI

When it comes to cryptocurrency tools and services, having convenient and alternative methods to exchange them outside of traditional Fiat options is very much needed to help work toward mass adoption. This is why we offer our users the ability to pay with different crypto to conveniently exchange quickly and easily for access to our services.

To make a payment with crypto, you can choose to use `Ethereum (ETH)`, `Dai (DAI)` or other Ethereum-based stablecoins for any of our services.

*To make use of your SAN tokens while also getting a hefty discount, please check [further below](/products-and-plans/how-to-pay-with-crypto/#burning-san-tokens-to-make-payments).*

To make a payment with ETH or DAI, simply send either form of crypto to this address:

**0x1F3dF0b8390BB8e9e322972C5e75583E87608Ec2**.

You can input:

`pay.santiment.eth`

in the send address as an alias to this respective payment address (see below screenshot).

For any assistance on making a payment, you can contact our team at [support@santiment.net](mailto:support@santiment.net) and it will auto-forward your conversation to our Intercom system for quick help.

> **Note:** If you opt to pay with ETH or DAI, any service is available to pay with this method.

## Burning SAN Tokens to Make Payments

SAN token holders can use a token burning method to make use of their SAN holdings instead of paying for a subscription the regular way. If you're unfamiliar with what burning entails, it's simply the act of intentionally sending tokens to an invalid address to permanently remove them from the available circulating supply.

Burning SAN tokens provides a substantial discount incentivization for our users who choose to take advantage of the opportunity. It lets you burn SAN tokens at a rate of twice the current market rate, which comes down to a 50% discount compared to regular payments. In addition, the total supply of SAN shrinks with every burn, benefitting all SAN holders.

Please make sure to note the following restrictions:

>
- Paying via SAN burn is limited to subscriptions of Sanbase, so it's not available for subscribing to SanAPI.
- SAN burn is not available for residents of the Swiss Confederation due to tax regulations.
- SAN burn can only be applied to yearly base subscription prices. No other discounts are applicable when using SAN burn.

> Thank you for your understanding.


In case you are ready to burn SAN for a yearly Sanbase Pro subscription, please let us know at [support@santiment.net](mailto:support@santiment.net) and we will be happy to walk you through the process.

## Providing SAN Uniswap Liquidity

Another way of getting Pro access to Sanbase is currently available: Providing liquidity for the SAN/ETH or SAN/BAC trading pairs on Uniswap V2!

As long as you provide 3000+ SAN to our Uniswap V2 pools (and the corresponding amount of ETH or BAC), you get FREE access to Sanbase Pro, including all our metrics, new templates and daily market insights!
