## Pay With ETH or DAI

When it comes to cryptocurrency tools and services, having convenient and alternative methods to exchange them outside of traditional Fiat options is very much needed to help work toward mass adoption. This is why we offer our users the ability to pay with different crypto to conveniently exchange quickly and easily for access to our services.

To make a payment with crypto, you can choose to use `Ethereum (ETH)`, `Dai (DAI)` or other Ethereum-based stablecoins for any of our services.

*To make use of your SAN tokens while also getting a hefty discount, please check [further below](/products-and-plans/how-to-pay-with-crypto/#burning-san-tokens-to-make-payments).*

To make a payment with ETH or DAI, simply send either form of crypto to this address:

**0x1F3dF0b8390BB8e9e322972C5e75583E87608Ec2**.

You can input:

`pay.santiment.eth`

in the send address as an alias to this respective payment address (see below screenshot).

## Burning SAN Tokens to Make Payments

Paying with SAN token provides a substantial discount incentivization for our users who choose to take advantage of the opportunity - and are quick enough to fill one of the limited slots. It lets you burn SAN tokens at a rate of 1USD each, which comes down to a hefty discount at current market rates.

- SAN burn is a restricted offer, only available to a certain amount of users each month. First come, first serve.
- SAN burn is not available for residents of the Swiss Confederation due to tax regulations.
