*This article describes how to stake SAN token that are already in your
posession. Please refer to* [*this
article*](/san-token/how-to-buy-san)
*to learn how to buy SAN in the first place.*

There are two ways to connect an Ethereum address to a Sanbase account.
You can use MetaMask as a first login (and add an email address later)
or add it to an existing account.

## Logging into Sanbase using MetaMask

This procedure is described in the article [Logging into
Sanbase](/sanbase/logging-into-sanbase),
please check there.

## Connecting a wallet to an already existing account

After logging into Sanbase using your email address you open the account
settings, which can be found in the upper right corner by hovering over
the account-icon:

In account settings, you will find the following option, click it:

In case your MetaMask plugin is not logged in yet, please do it now as
prompted.


*Please note that MetaMask can create a local wallet within the browser,
import a wallet in multiple ways, or be connected to a hardware wallet
like the Ledger Nano S. Make sure your tokens are safe!*

**Please confirm the following step to let Sanbase connect to MetaMask
(and the selected wallet):**

You will now be asked to sign a message with your private key. Please
note that this is not a transaction, no tokens are sent, no changes are
made to the blockchain. This step simply proves that the connected
account is in your control and hereby belongs to you.

After confirmation, you will see your address and SAN token balance in
the account settings.

*Please note: **Staking** currently means holding a certain number of tokens at an
ETH address that Sanbase can check each time you visit (it's a lot like
maintaining a minimum balance in a bank account). In the future, we plan
to implement a more advanced staking mechanism.*
