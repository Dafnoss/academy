author: Santiment Team
description: This page shows a fast overview on your watchlists and common categories

## Structure

This page contain two sections:

1. **`Categories`**
   These topics are specific asset lists that the
   Santiment Team created based on a certain aspect of the assets, e.g.
   `Stablecoins`. In case you have any feedback on these or you think we
   might be missing tokens in one of them, please consider getting in
   touch.

2. **`Watchlists`** basically the same as **Categories**, but can be created by
   anyone.

## Categories what we have

- **`All Assets`** - contains all tokens we track across different blockchains.
- **`ERC 20`** - shows Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens only
- **`Top 50 ERC20`** - dynamic category, shows the 50 most prominent ERC20 projects
  we track.
- **`Stablecoins`** - a curated list of assets that are supposed to
  have a fixed value
- **`Decentralized Exchanges`** - a curated list of decentralized
  exchanges and their utility tokens
- **`Centralized Exchanges`** - a curated list of regular exchanges
  and their utility tokens
- **`Emerging trending assets`** - dynamic category with assets that in our [**_Emerging trends_**](/sanbase/emerging-trends-page) today.

Each category page inside have the similar table as in the **_Watchlist page_**, but you can't modify the list of assets
