The **Social Trends** page provides a list of the `Top 10` trending words in the crypto world.

You can start exploring the Social Trends page [here](https://app.santiment.net/labs/trends/).

The purpose of these lists is twofold:

- To provide a quick overview of the most significant topics currently developing in the crypto world.
- To assist you in identifying hype peaks and local tops.

## Calculation Methodology

This list is not designed to calculate the most frequently used words on crypto social media **overall**. Such a list would often include redundant words such as `Bitcoin`, `Ethereum`, `crypto`, etc. 

Instead, our goal is to identify the most significant **developing** or **emerging** stories within the crypto community. As a result, you'll find a fresh set of topics each day, reflecting the current trends on crypto social media. 

To achieve this, we calculate the top 10 words that have seen the most significant increase in social media mentions every 9 hours, compared to their average social volume over the previous 2 weeks. 

This method helps identify topics that have recently sparked high interest, despite previously being overlooked. It makes the list a practical tool for discovering new and developing discussion points within the crypto community. 

The data for these results is sourced from over 1000 crypto-specific social media channels, including:

- 500+ Telegram groups
- 520+ crypto subreddits
- 5000+ Twitter accounts
- BitcoinTalk

## How to use it

1. **Get a 1-minute overview of the biggest (developing) stories in crypto**

   The world of crypto social media is filled with daily noise and numerous minor or irrelevant stories published on crypto news sites. Our curated list filters out this noise, focusing only on topics that have garnered significant attention. This process helps identify the **social winners** and eliminate **social losers**, allowing you to understand where the community focus lies at any given moment. Additionally, our list often highlights important stories that might have been overlooked by major crypto publications.

2. **Spot local tops and hype peaks**

   Based on our experience, we've found that the appearance of a coin's ticker on our Top 10 list can serve as an effective indicator of a local top. If the coin is already in an uptrend, its presence on our list could suggest that a local top is imminent, indicating that the hype surrounding the coin has reached its peak.

## Explanation for all columns

Apart from the actual words, our list includes several columns that provide additional context to the results:

## Hype Score (Hidden Column)

The Hype Score is the primary criterion for ranking words on our list. It's based on a [sophisticated formula](/metrics/emerging-trends/#hype-score) developed by Santiment, which analyzes all social media messages. Using a dozen parameters, it ranks the words by the likelihood of sustained chatter. 

A higher **Hype Score** indicates a greater likelihood that a particular word or topic will continue to be discussed in the near future. Conversely, a lower **Hype Score** suggests that although a word or topic is currently popular in the crypto world, it's gradually losing the crowd's attention. 

While the **Social Volume** represents the total number of social mentions for each word, the **Hype Score** is more complex. It aims to predict which of the top 10 words are more likely to continue being discussed on crypto social media, and which are beginning to lose momentum. 

## Social Volume

Social Volume represents the total count of mentions for a specific word or topic on cryptocurrency-related social media platforms for the current day. The number displayed next to it, highlighted in either green or red, indicates the increase or decrease in social media mentions today in comparison to the previous day.
