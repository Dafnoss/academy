As we are working directly with Ethereum on-chain data, we have the
ability to display information about any token which contract address is
known. As there is a lot of noise in the token space though, we decided
to make only a curated (and ever expanding) list of tokens searchable on
SANbase.

To request a new token to be added to said list, please use [this
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFuCxjJjId98u1Bp3qpXCq2A9YAQ02OEdhOgiM9Hr-rMDxhQ/viewform).
We appreciate token holders requesting their favorite tokens, but we
will favor direct requests from a project\'s team, especially the ones
supplying information about their funding.
