As we are working directly with Ethereum on-chain data, we have the
ability to display information about any token which contract address is
known. As there is a lot of noise in the token space though, we decided

Sanbase.

You can use the following form to request a new token to be added to
Sanbase or to add a known team wallet containing significant assets
held by the team:

We appreciate token holders requesting their favorite tokens, but we
will favor direct requests from a project's team, especially the ones
supplying information about their funding.
