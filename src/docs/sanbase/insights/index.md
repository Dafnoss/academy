body of it:

As soon as title and body of insight are filled, Sanbase will start saving your
progress as a draft.

Also, you can add tags to your idea. Insights can have up to five
tags, which should correspond to the tickers of the crypto assets your
Insight is talking about.

As you can see, you also have the option to straight up share your
Insight with the public.

## Publish or delete drafts insight

Under `My drafts` you will find insights you started but did not
publish to other users yet. They can be deleted or edited (and then shared) with the
buttons on the right.
