*Please note: There are two ways to log into SANbase, by*
[*MetaMask*](https://metamask.io/) *and by email, but both can (and
should be) connected to the same account for ease of use.*

## First Login using MetaMask

When you first visit Sanbase at <https://app.santiment.net>, you will
find the login option in the upper right corner of the screen when
hovering your mouse over the last symbol:

Selecting `Log in` will lead you to the choice of either using
MetaMask or email for your login. Select the MetaMask option for now.

The MetaMask plugin will now ask you for permission to display your
currently selected account\'s public data to the SANbase website. Click
`Connect` to let the plugin and the website talk to each other.

In case you are missing this window, please note the MetaMask icon in
the upper right corner of the screen shows little message indicator:

Clicking the MetaMask icon will bring the missing window to the front.


As soon as MetaMask and Sanbase are connected, you should see the
following screen:

Click `Sign in with Metamask`. Another prompt should appear:

Click `SIGN` to securely sign a message with your private key, hereby
proving that you are the owner of the connected account. You are now
logged into Sanbase.


#### Adding your email

When hovering over the account symbol in the upper right corner, you
will now see additional options, including account settings. Fill in
your email address there.

From now on you can log in by either MetaMask or email, you will end up
in the same account. You can find out more about the Account settings
page by reading [this
article](/intercom-articles/getting-started/sanbase/account-settings).

## Login by email

Logging into Sanbase by email is pretty straight forward. You enter your
email address and get sent a link to a logged in Sanbase session. In
case you logged in by email the first time, you can add an ETH address
using MetaMask through the Account settings page mentioned above. Find
out more in the article on how to stake SAN tokens linked to below.

### Buying and staking SAN

You are now ready to stake SAN to get access to more data, including
real time data and historical data for many metrics - as well as access
to Sangraphs (<https://data.santiment.net>). You can learn how to stake
