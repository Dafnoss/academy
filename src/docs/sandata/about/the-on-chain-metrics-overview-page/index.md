*This article is about the On-chain metrics overview for specific ERC-20
tokens, which can be found through* [*`The ERC-20 overview
page`*](/sandata/about/the-erc-20-overview-page)*.
It will list the current metrics that are part of this overview and link
to their respective knowledge base article, where available.

Please note that `Top Holders` metrics, albeit being on-chain in
nature, are not part of this overview and have their own one, which can
be found through the ERC-20 overview page mentioned above.*

The metrics are split into several categories as shown in the
