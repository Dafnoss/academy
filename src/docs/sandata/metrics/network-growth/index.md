Here's a Network Growth graph for [Aragon](https://aragon.org/), which
lets anyone create and manage a decentralized organization on Ethereum.

Between February and December of 2017, the Aragon network grew by 85-750
new addresses each day, and the price loyally followed.

Then, right around the start of 2018, the network growth slowly began to
throttle. It indicated that the Aragon user base was already quite deep,
and wouldn't be able to sustain future price growth.

What happened since speaks for itself.
