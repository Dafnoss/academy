title: Sandata - Social Volume
author: Santiment Team

The Social Volume metric lets you select a certain project out of a
curated list of crypto projects, which can be found at the top of the
page:

The graphs will show you how often that project has been mentioned
within a certain interval and time frame across all channels of the
given source. We show separate graphs for different sources, e.g.
Telegram or Discord channels.

Currently (03/11/2019) there are 56 projects tracked regarding Social
Volume. As every added project needs additional resources and a manually
curated list of search terms to include, we cannot simply add all known
projects to this list. Thank you for your understanding.

In case you still think we might be missing an important project, please
feel invited to join [our Discord
server](https://santiment.net/discord).
