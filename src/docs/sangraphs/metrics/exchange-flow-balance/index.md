Exchange Flow Balance shows the combined values of tokens moving in and
out of exchange wallets on a certain date.

If the value is positive on said date, more of a particular token
entered the exchanges than left, and vice versa.

It's not uncommon for large inflows of tokens to the exchange to precede
rapid price growth.

Here's that exact scenario in case of
[aeternity](https://aeternity.com/), a blockchain platform that enables
scalable smart contracts:

When a large amount of tokens flow out of the exchange, on the other
hand, the price is likely to fall soon thereafter.

The below graph shows lots of [DICE](https://etheroll.com/) tokens moving
out of exchange wallets during a price rally; the price plunged
following the event.
