This graph shows the amount of tokens changing addresses on a certain
date, multiplied by the number of blocks created on the blockchain since
they last moved.

Spikes on the graph signal a large amount of tokens moving after being
idle for an extended period of time.

One potential use case for this metric is identifying when big market
players exit the project post ICO. Let's look at an example:

Here's the Token Age Consumed graph for [Golem](https://golem.network/),
an ERC-20 project that lets you rent other people's computing power.

We can easily spot several significant spikes over time: each could be a
large early investor selling their tokens, which commonly results in a
parallel price decline.
