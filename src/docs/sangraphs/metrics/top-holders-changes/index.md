article*](/intercom-articles/metrics-explained/sangraphs/metrics-about-top-holders)

This graph shows the total number of new addresses entering the top
holders list.

The amount of top holders addresses included in the calculation can be
chosen at the top by selecting \'HoldersCount\'. The HoldersCount in the
above screenshot of BAT\'s changes to the top holders list is set to 50.
So at the day shown in the screenshot, three out of 50 addresses where
not in the 50 top holders list the day before.\

The assets\'s price can be displayed in USD or BTC, which can be
selected through the \'Currency\' field at the top.
