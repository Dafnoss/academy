*This article mentions one of several metrics we offer regarding top
holders addresses. Please check* [*this
article*](/sangraphs/metrics/top-holders)
*for an introduction on `Top Holders` and the complete list of metrics
offered.*

The last part of our Top Holders metrics is the Details table. It shows
detailed data for the top holders for the selected period, sorted by
date (the current day compared to the previous day).

The **status** column specifies whether the address either (was)

1.  `added`
2.  `removed`
3.  `remained` unchanged

from that particular spot in the top holders list on the given day.
Select `Hide "remains" status in details` to toggle on showing the
`remains` status, which will make it easier to see the full list of top
holders accounts for a particular day.

Along with the rank among the top holders, the table shows **balance**
(the balance of that particular account, in amount of tokens or USD) and
**% of total** (the share of the total token supply this specific top
holders address holds) - both for the day listed and the previous one.

In case you are having trouble finding specific data points in this
potentially very long list, please consider reducing the time frame -
either by using the options in the upper right corner of the screen or
by selecting a time frame straight in the graph by clicking and dragging
your mouse. The Details list will only show data from the selected time
frame.

Clicking any top holders address will lead you to its details on
<https://etherscan.io>.
