`Top Holders` describes a set of up to 100 Ethereum addresses which
have the highest balances at a given time, either in Ether or in a
specific ERC-20 token. The amount of addresses can be reduced, but 100
is the maximum. So one could analyse the 20 top holders for BAT, as well
as the 100 top holders for ETH.

Top Holders metrics are calculated daily.

The top holder metrics can be found under `ETH Top Holders` for Ether
(ETH) itself. To find top holder information about a specific ERC-20
token, look for `Overview. All ERC-20 tokens`, which will lead you to
a list of all ERC-20 tokens Santiment is currently including in its
calculations. Find the needed token and select `Open Dashboard` in the
very last column, which should be named `Top Holders`.

As all top holder metrics are shown in the same overview, they share a
set of options:

***`Currency`*** - lets you switch the price from being displayed in
USD to BTC
***`HoldersCount`*** - sets the amount of top holders to include,
maximum is 100
***`Hide "remains" status in details`*** - refers only to the fourth
metric listed below and hides specific table rows. See its article for
more information
***`Balance in USD`*** - display the top holders balances in amount of
tokens or converted to USD
