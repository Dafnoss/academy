## Definition

**Large Exchange Transactions** indicates that large transactions has been made.

We take transaction of the last 30 days and updating this table every day and get values of top10 transaction volume(threshold) in usd for all assets. 
Then we take all the transactions that have transaction volume more than this threshold separately for each asset.
